## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I was interestested in using Seattle AirBnB data from 2016 to better understand:

1. Which neighborhoods in Seattle are in the highest demand?
2. How does the demand for different neighborhoods change over the course of the year?
3. Which neighbrohoods show a dramatic changes in thier availability over the year?

The data set for this analysis is publicly available at <a href=https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/seattle/data>Kaggle</a> and is included here.

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

The notebook available here showcases work related to the above questions.  The notebook is exploratory in searching through the data pertaining to the questions showcased by the notebook title.  Markdown cells within the notebook assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.  

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://carrie-kruppa.medium.com/how-do-you-know-where-to-buy-fdecfc27c7c0).
